## Indian Human Image Classification Model
## Project Overview
In this project we are aiming to build a sophisticated model that can effectively classify human images.The model will be trained on a diverse dataset encompassing different skin tones (Fair, Mild, and Dark) and will demonstrate optimal prediction results for both males and females.

## Project Flow
## 1. Data Collection
 Collected human images from various sources. This collection will be diverse, covering a range of skin tones and including both male and female subjects. 

## 2. Data Cleaning
The collected dataset will undergo a rigorous cleaning process to remove any irrelevant or unwanted data. This ensures that our model is trained on high-quality, relevant images, improving its accuracy and reliability.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the model, we will preprocess it to meet the specific requirements of image classification. This involves tasks such as resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and organizing the dataset into suitable categories.

## 4. Model Building

Model Architecture: We'll design a robust architecture, incorporating convolutional layers for effective feature extraction from images.

Training: The model will be trained using our preprocessed dataset, ensuring a balanced representation of different skin tones and gender.

Evaluation: will assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

Saving Images: After successful training, our model will classify and save 1000  human images. This will serve as a tangible output, showcasing the model's capability.
## Dataset
Our dataset will be carefully curated to include:
Diverse human images with representations of Fair, Mild, and Dark skin tones.
A balanced distribution of male and female subjects.
Task
The primary task is to build a model that accurately classifies images as human or others. The model should be capable of understanding and classifying diverse skin tones and genders effectively.
Ethical Considerations
Throughout the project, we prioritize ethical considerations, ensuring fair representation and unbiased classification. The goal is to create a model that respects and embraces the diversity of human appearances.


Happy coding!
